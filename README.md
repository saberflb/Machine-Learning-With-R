# Machine-Learning-With-R

This is going to be a record of the learning paths following the book by Brett Lantz on the topic of machine learning with R. In particular I will work out projects on the following topics.

1. Classification using Nearest Neighbors
2. Classification using Probability (Bayes)
3. Classification using Divide and Conquer (Decision Tree)
4. Regression (Linear Regression/ Regression Tree/ Model Tree)
5. Clustering with k-means
6. Neural Networks & SVM
7. Improvement
8. Pattern In general
